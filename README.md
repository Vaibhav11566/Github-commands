 ### UPDATE: A better way! (August 2015)

As pointed out by @johntyree in the comments, using [git reflog](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) is easier and more reliable. Thanks for the suggestion!

```
 $ git reflog
1ed7510 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from develop to 1ed7510
3970d09 HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from b-fix-build to develop
1ed7510 HEAD@{3}: commit: got everything working the way I want
70b3696 HEAD@{4}: commit: upgrade rails, do some refactoring
98f2fc2 HEAD@{5}: commit: a couple code cleanups
d09f35e HEAD@{6}: commit: remove test method - it served it's purpose and now it must go
d586a93 HEAD@{10}: commit: aha! that is why I'm so fail
4644046 HEAD@{11}: commit: cleaning up the initial migration for dev/test environments
323df37 HEAD@{15}: commit: bump ruby version
eab861c HEAD@{16}: commit: bundle update EVERYTHING
2b544c4 HEAD@{17}: commit: fixing what few tests actually exist - a.k.a., wow! does this app even work?
3970d09 HEAD@{18}: checkout: moving from develop to b-fix-build
3970d09 HEAD@{19}: pull: Fast-forward
```

Once you find the commit you're looking for, create a new branch from it and you're done!

```sh
$ git checkout -b branch-name 70b3696
Switched to a new branch 'branch-name'
```


### Original post

Oops! I accidentally deleted a local git branch, and I haven't pushed it to a remote server yet. The branch has several important commits, and it hasn't been merged with any other branches yet. How do I find the missing branch?

### 1. Create a list of all dangling or unreachable commits.

```sh
$ git fsck --full --no-reflogs --unreachable --lost-found
unreachable tree 4a407b1b09e0d8a16be70aa1547332432a698e18
unreachable tree 5040d8cf08c78119e66b9a3f8c4b61a240229259
unreachable tree 60c0ce61b040f5e604850f747f525e88043dae12
unreachable tree f080522d06b9853a2f18eeeb898724da4af7aed9
unreachable blob bf01f514add2ada00a7ae5c666493d30d639018c
...
```

These commits are copied into `.git/lost-found/commit/`, and non-commit objects are copied into `.git/lost-found/other/`.

### 2. Print a list of commit messages for all commits in the lost and found.

```sh
$ ls -1 .git/lost-found/commit/ | xargs -n 1 git log -n 1 --pretty=oneline

```

### 3. Find your missing commit through the process of manual inspection (i.e. reading).

If you need more information on a commit, you can always use a more detailed log command, such as `git log -p --stat --color 9ae38fc`.

### 4. Create a new branch with the missing commit as the branch head.

```sh
$ git checkout -b branch-name 9ae38fc
Switched to a new branch 'branch-name'
```
